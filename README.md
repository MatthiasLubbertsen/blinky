## What's this?

Blinky is a fun little web-based screensaver that puts a pair of adorable eyes on any display. It works by connecting two web pages via WebSocket: one page shows Blinky's eyes on your main display, while another page runs on your phone to detect faces using its camera. When someone walks by, the phone detects their face and instantly tells Blinky to react through the WebSocket connection! Perfect for:

- Your work desk setup
- Shop windows
- Office spaces
- Smart mirror projects
- Anywhere that needs a bit more personality!

## Quick Start

1. First, make sure you have Node.js >=18 installed
2. Clone this repo
3. Install openssl if you haven't already
4. Generate a self-signed certificate:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certs/server.key -out certs/server.cert
```
Fill in the prompts (this is an example, fill in your own data):
```
Country Name: NL
State or Province Name: NL
Locality Name: NL
Organization Name: blinky
Organizational Unit: blinky
Common Name: Matthias Lubbertsen
Email: (can be skipped)
```
5. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
6. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

1. Open https://YOUR_IP:8080 _(ip can be found in terminal)_ in Chrome on a computer or laptop (for bigger screen). Other browsers have not been tested yet, see GitHub issues for browser compatibility updates.
   - You'll get a security warning (self-signed cert)
   - Click "More info/Details" then "Continue to unsafe site"
   - This loads the Blinky eyes interface that will react to detected faces
   - It automatically connects to the server via WebSocket to receive face detection events

2. On your phone (or another device), open https://YOUR_IP:8080/camera _(ip can be found in terminal)_
   - This loads the camera interface that does the face detection
   - When faces are detected, it sends that data to the server
   - The server then notifies the Blinky eyes interface via WebSocket
   - Blinky will show a thought bubble message when faces are detected

3. Watch Blinky react when faces are detected on the phone camera!

   - Click "More info/Details" then "Continue to unsafe site"
   - Accept the camera permission
   - Click "Start Detection"
3. Watch Blinky react when faces are detected!
