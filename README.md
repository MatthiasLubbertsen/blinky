## What's this?

Blinky is a fun little web-based screensaver that puts a pair of adorable eyes on any display. Hook it up to a phone running face detection, and watch as Blinky reacts to people walking by! Perfect for:

- Your work desk setup
- Shop windows
- Office spaces
- Smart mirror projects
- Anywhere that needs a bit more personality!

## Quick Start

1. First, make sure you have Node.js >=18 installed
2. Clone this repo
3. Install openssl if you haven't already
4. Generate a self-signed certificate:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certs/server.key -out certs/server.cert
```
Fill in the prompts (this is an example, fill in your own data):
